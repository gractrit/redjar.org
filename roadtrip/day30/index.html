There she was suprised by a much bigger dog, when our bossy puppy         suddenly becomes quite shy. </p>      <p>Today we set out for Seattle, and plan to meet up with out friend Sophia         after her summer school class at night. So, to entertain ourselves until         then we decide to make an excursion to Mt.Ranier. The National Park is         huge and beautiful. It is so diverse with gorges, wildflowers, waterfalls,         and yes- a really really big mountain (Mt.Ranier is really an <em>active</em>         volcano!). We admired the mountain, walked along the gorges, collected         some snow, and then took a spritzer near the waterfall. Despite the snow,         (which comes from one the mountains many glaciers), it was quite hot in         the park- a whopping 93 degrees!</p>      <p>Unfortunately our waterfall rainshower did not keep us cool for long.         After exiting the park we stopped at a local swimming area to cool our         feet. Ogden cooled all four of hers. Still a little early to meet Sophia,         we lingered just south of Seattle to gape at the Tacoma Narrows Bridge         site. (For those readers not in Corin's physics class, this is a Physics         National Monument. A prior bridge in this expanse was ruined by harmonic         motion alone!)</p>      <p>We then headed into Seattle and enjoyed a leisurely and excellent Thai         food dinner at &quot;Angel's Thai Cusine&quot;. We met Sophia, and were         soon on the ferry to her home in Vashon Island. Vashon is right off the         coast of Seattle, and we are spending the weekend with Sophia. On our         last visit, we both were quite taken by Seattle and her island, and it         is well worth this return effort!</p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2541.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2543.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Packing up camp.</td>    <td>Beverage for the car and for the humans.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2544.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2545.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Mt.
