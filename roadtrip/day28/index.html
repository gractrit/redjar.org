Oregon is full of tall pointy evergreens, and other lush woodlands         that seem to bend over the roads. There are also cows here, which are         strangely nice to see again. </p>      <p>We made a quick stop in Corvalis to use the technology resources of the         University of Oregon (go Beavers!). While Ogden and Corin were playing         fetch here, Ogden got loose and tried to steel some girl's lunch. But,         as mentioned, Oregon is a dog friendly state and the girl just laughed         it off. </p>      <p>Before we knew it we had arrived at Kim's house in Aloha, OR. We settled         in, went for a walk around her town, and ended up at the elementry school         which she attended as a kid. When we returned, Kim's mom treated us to         a wonderful dinner. We were happy to have napkins and a meal who's main         ingredient was not peanut butter.</p>      <p>After dinner we learned a new card game, and then off to sleep on a big         comfy mattress. A big thank you to the Schulze family for having us for         the night.</p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2508.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2509.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Oregon State University library.</td>    <td>Kim's house in Aloha, OR.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2518.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2514.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>A walk down memory lane. </td>    <td>Hello from Oregon!</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2511.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2516.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Corin helps Ogden on the swing. </td>    <td>So this is Oregon, huh?</td>  </tr>  <tr align="right">     <td colspan="2"><hr size="1" noshade></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td colspan="2"><p><a href="../">Home</a> | &lt;- <a href="/roadtrip/day27">Day         27 </a> | <a href="/roadtrip/day29">Day 29</a> -&gt;</p></td>  </tr></table><!-- start google analytics --><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">_uacct = "UA-127434-1";urchinTracker();</script><!-- end google analytics --></body></html>
