Temperatures varied from 47 to         95. </p>      <p>We zoomed north on I 25. Did we mention many of the higways have a speedlimit         of 75 mph?</p>      <p>We stopped Walsenburg, CO for lunch.</p>      <p>Finished listening to The Brethren. Not the most enjoyable book we've         listened to yet.</p>      <p>Entered Colorado Springs in the afternoon. We drove around a bunch, checking         out downtown via car. Stopped at Colorado College and then University         of Colorado. Gave Ogden some excercise and we checked our email. The streets         in this city are wide and the views spectacular. </p>      <p>After looking around town for a hotel to stay in, we decide to just camp         again. The RV/campgrounds are no good, and the hotel's are $90. We ventured         west to Mueller State Park. We took a chance since we didn't even know         if the park was open (forest fires). And if it was open, we weren't sure         if they would have any room since it was Friday. As we drove up into the         mountains, the temperature began dropping significantly. State Parks have         been good to us. That had room for us. The campsite had a view and some         nice coin showers. </p>      <p>Dinner at Fiesta Mexicana. Corin's meal comes out on a plate the size         of a bicycle tire.The servers were actually Mexican and the food was too.       </p>      <p>Back to camp. Everything that has an odor gets locked in the car to prevent         a visit from curious bears. One game of Rummy 500 and then off to sleep         warm in our sleeping bags. </p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2217.JPG" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2218.JPG" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Entering Colorful Colorado.
