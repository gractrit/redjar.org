This made for a very icky beginning to the day.         We took showers and set off up the coast. We stopped not to far up to         play on the shore. Oregon is a very dog friendly state. There are five         dogs in the state brochure, and the beaches are leash free (and all public).         So we had an extensive romp in the Pacific waters. </p>      <p>We stopped at a small oceanside cove and looked at the Oregon Natural         Arches, made by the lapping waves.We also paused to see the sand dunes,         known as Oregon's Sahara. </p>      <p>Further up the shore we enjoyed lunch in the Old Town section of Bandon.         Looking out at the sea we had some great seafood from the sidewalk market.         We stopped again soon at the sea lion caves, and saw, heard, and smelled         the big sea creatures! The Oregon coast was still good looking even though         overcast and chilly. </p>      <p>After looking at two campsites, we eventually decided to stay at Beverly         Beach State Park. Oregon has state parks lining the coast, and it was         easy to be discerning. We pull up in the front of a long line of cars         to register at Beverly Beach, and find ourselves waiting for a man on         foot to finish registering. We soon realize that this guy is from the         last car in line, and just walked to the front. Jared, empowered by the         Jersey liscense plates, gets out of the car and confronts the guy. &quot;Are         you in one of these cars?&quot; he asked. &quot;Didn't you see all these         cars in front of you registering?&quot; When the guy proclaimed that he         didn't know what the fuss was about, the woman behind the desk told him         to get back in his car. Two points- Jared. </p>      <p>We had rented a DVD (Gosford Park), but did not make it through because         of limited battery time and sleepiness. We were full of PB&amp;J, and         slept well that night despite the rain. </p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2479.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2480.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Read the sign.</td>    <td>A natural bridge.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2481.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2484.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Ocean cove.</td>    <td>Ogden plays keep away from Corin.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2492.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2494.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Then Ogden plays keep away from Jared.</td>    <td>Seafood lunch in Bandon, OR</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2498.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2500.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Sand dunes in Oregon?</td>    <td>Corin fights off the reporters.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2502.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2503.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>A lighthouse from a distance.</td>    <td>Sea Lions from a distance.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td height="206"><img src="images/DCP_2506.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2507.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>How to make PB&amp;J's on the tailgate of a car.</td>    <td>Campsite E17.
