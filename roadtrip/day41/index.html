        Forty-One</p>
      <p><strong>Batchwana Bay, ON  - Ottawa, ON<br>
        Date:</strong> 07/21/2002<br>
        <strong>Distance:</strong> 547 miles<br>
        <strong>Weather:</strong> Cloudy. high 70's</p>
      <p>Early morning thunderstorm filled the $50 tent with pools of water.  Jared awoke every 5 minutes to check on the growing puddle next to his head.</p>
      <p>Stopped at Saint Ste Marie (the Soo)  for gas.  Gas guy went on and on, with &quot;eh's&quot; every other word about his next door neighbor's dog.</p>
      <p>The Trans Canada Higway should be ashamed.  East of the Soo it was under heavy construction which appeared to have been abandoned for a while. Further down the &quot;highway&quot; you are passing little houses whose driveways go directly on to the, one lane each direction, road.</p>
      <p>We did a quick drive by of Sudbury and confirmed our travel book's assertion that it is indeed one of the uglier urban centers.</p>
      <p>Lunch in Sturgeion Falls.  A pizza place next to the Canadian sandwich chain, &quot;Mr. Sub&quot;. The funny thing here is that the pizza place had stolen the Mr. Sub napkins.  For dessert, a Cadbury bar called &quot;crunchie&quot;.  It was sponge toffee - interesting.</p>
      <p>Listened to the Simpsons on the radio.  It was the Episode where they go to Canada which was pretty funny.  Only have the audio was also funny.</p>
      <p>Finally made it to Ottawa. Stayed in style at a Days Inn.  A real bed! (Ogden had to stay in the car though.)</p>
