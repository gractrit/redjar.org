After         our second english muffin we noticed that the day was slipping away, so         away we went. </p>      <p>First out of Utah, then through Arizona, and onto Nevada. In Nevada we         detour at LasVegas, and admire the city from afar on our way to the Hoover         Dam. Yes, the rumors you have heard are true- the dam is big. Lake Meade         was lovely, and so was the quick lunch we had in Boulder City. The picnic         lunch was from a deli run from a nice Italian guy from Long Island. We         enjoyed our sandwiches at a small city park that was being tended by almost         12 Nevada State Parks employees.</p>      <p>We left the dam and drove and drove and drove. Right into Death Valley.         Yes, the rumors you have heard about Death Valley are true- the valley         is hot. We drove through at sunset, and never once feared for our lives.         When we popped out of Death Valley we were in California. </p>      <p>We went to a local all night diner in Lone Pine, California, called PJ's.         By this time it is dark and late and we are ready to sleep. Once we decided         on a quasi-campground we set to the tast of erecting our new tent in the         dark. And, to make this task more challenging, we were attacked again         by gusts of wind from the mountains. </p>      <p>However, this tent made it through the night and so did we. It is a nice         new tent and seems so much bigger than our previous dwelling. Corin can         stand up in the middle and Ogden practically has her own wing. </p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2324.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2325.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Sqeaking through the North-West corner of Arizona. </td>    <td>Quick, take a picture before we leave AZ.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2326.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2327.jpg" width="199" height="300"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Welcome to Nevada where gambling and prostitution just keep drawin' in       the tourists. </td>    <td>Slot machines in a gas station.
