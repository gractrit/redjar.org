Exploring and         looking for breakfast. We ended up in Tahoe City. A toursity street with         lots of nice shops. We found Syd's baglery. How sweet it was to have a         bagel. There doesn't seem to be a single bagel shop in the south. A cinnimon         raison bagel toasted with butter for both of us and we were ready to see         the town. We walked around with Ogden and went down to the beach to test         the water. We also took the opportunity to do our Laundy.</p>      <p>We then headed back towards the eastern side of the lake and stopped         at the Safeway to stock up on food for lunch and dinner.</p>      <p>On our way home, we stopped at a mini-golf spot for 18 holes of dinasour         fun. The place had 3 different elaborate courses. Jared's lack of concentration,         and Corin's stellar putting made the game no contest. Even Jared's two         hol- in-ones weren't enough.</p>      <p>We headed back to camp. Relaxed for a bit, played some cards.</p>      <p>We then cooked up a traditional fourth of July dinner, hot dogs, on our         camp stove. </p>      <p>After dinner, we walked up the road to a view of the lake to observe         the fireworks on the other side. They started late, or what we thought         was late. The lake is about 12 miles wide, so they were smaller and we         couldn't even hear the booms. But they were a lot of them and they were         nice to view from a distance. We also picked a spot popular with the locals,         so at least it was an authentic Lake Tahoe fourth. </p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2396.jpg" width="199" height="300"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2398.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Breakfast at Syd's Bagelry.</td>    <td>Lake Tahoe beach.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2399.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2400.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>A firefighter takes a break to swing.</td>    <td>Corin tests the blue water.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2402.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2404.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>When geese attack.</td>    <td>Doing laundry in style.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2405.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2407.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Lunch and dinner stuff at Safeway.</td>    <td>Miniature Golf.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2408.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2409.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Rummy 500 in the tent.</td>    <td>Jared cooks some 4th of July hot dogs.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2411.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2415.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Waiting for the fireworks.</td>    <td>A view of the fireworks from across the lake.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="right">     <td colspan="2"><hr size="1" noshade></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td colspan="2"><a href="../">Home</a> | &lt;- <a href="/roadtrip/day23">Day       23</a>| <a href="/roadtrip/day25">Day 25</a> -&gt;</td>  </tr></table><!-- start google analytics --><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">_uacct = "UA-127434-1";urchinTracker();</script><!-- end google analytics --></body></html>
