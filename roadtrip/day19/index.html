Advice to those who         use such things in the future- One: the shower begins right after you         put in the minimum amount of coins. Two: time yourself so that you are         not caught with shampoo in your hair or toothpaste in your mouth when         the water suddenly shuts off. </p>      <p>Heading back towards the town of Colorado Springs we decided to engage         in some distinctly touristy activities. First, a visit to the Manitou         Cliff Dwellings. Aside from the &quot;boisterous&quot; middle school kids         and a gift shop bigger than a museum, the dwellings were pretty neato.         It was such a small and rocky place to put a family- but remarkable in         its craftsmanship. </p>      <p>Next onto Colorado's Garden of the Gods, a famous collection of rock         formations and scenic views. At the rock garden, near the base of Pikes         Peak Mountain, we joined an annoying throng of people. However, a short         deviation from the trail found us eaily alone to enjoy the scenery, which         Ogden then tried to eat. </p>      <p>Driving north towards Denver we made our next destination a swanky outdoor         mall nearby the city. This does sound like an odd detour, even for us,         but there was both an Apple Store there and a Bananna Republic. Jared         updated the website and checked email, and Corin bought a lovely new frock         for work. We retrieved our retriever and also had lunch there- which was         an excellent fare from an eatery who's motto is &quot;a loaf of bread         in every arm.&quot;</p>      <p>Okay, now for the driving. A trek along Interstate 70. We stopped at         the Loveland Pass, climbing high into the sky for an awesome walk along         the continental divide. There was actually snow that high up! Jared built         a snowman, and Ogden knocked it down. All three slipped and slided like         it was December. Overall, Route 70 is lovely. Everytime you look out and         up you see the giant Rocky Mountains. </p>      <p>On to the fires. When we were just outside of Denver we saw smoke billowing         in the distance. When we stopped for dinner at a small town outside of         Aspen, all of the trees on the other side of highway were burned. We asked         two high school girls about the trees and they said a forest fire had         swept through 3 weeks ago. It ruined a bunch of homes, including one of         the girl's home. She had just gotten new converse shoes because her's         melted in the fire.</p>      <p>After the most bizarre &quot;hot dog&quot; dinner, we continued west         in search of a place to stay. There was a KOA campground just down the         road, so we went to check out. We went four miles, then turned on to the         road, only to be confronted by a police officer blocking the road. Another         forest fire. He recommended we continue further west. We decided it was         some good advice.</p>      <p>A few more miles down I-70 we stopped at a Super 8 to see about a room         since it was 9:30 pm. Smoking rooms only, $64, and the guy was kind of         a jerk. We were both awake, so we thought we would head a few more miles         east to a nearby state park. We stopped almost an hour later and set up         camp in the dark. Then right to sleep. WELL ALMOST- Ogden decided that         she would try being a guard dog for a night and each small sound woke         her up with bursts of barks. We left early the next morning to avoid restitution         from the neighbors.</p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2241.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2235.jpg" width="199" height="300"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Cliff dwellings.</td>    <td>A door just the right size for Corin.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2242.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2243.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Pueblo &quot;museum&quot;.</td>    <td>Garden of the gods.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2244.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2245.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>A 300 x 200 pixel picture does these views no justice.</td>    <td>Ogden gets out the map.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2246.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2247.jpg" width="200" height="300"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Ogden's photography is really coming along.</td>    <td>Ogden eating the scenery.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2249.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2250.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Lunch.</td>    <td>Visit to the Apple store for a replacement tab key.
