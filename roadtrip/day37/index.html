This was not difficult since we could         see/hear it from our campsite. We drove East into Calgary, and stopped         at the University for email. We then headed into the downtown of Calgary         to sigthsee on Stephen Avenue. This street is for pedestrians only and         has lots of shops and restaurants. Corin went into a Lebanese restaurant,         and discovered that is was owned by the author of one of her cookbooks.         The author was working at the cash register, and took Corin's order. </p>      <p>We drove further East and stopped in the town of Medicine Hat. This city         was formed when the Canadian Pacific Railroad, drilling for water, hit         natural gas. Today the streetlamps are still powered by natural gas. </p>      <p>The entire drive today was in the Plains region of Canada. It is window         after window of flat far-reaching grasslands. It was also very hot, a         good day to drive many miles. We stopped for the night outside of Swift         Current, at the Saskatchewan Landing Provincial Park. This was a lovley         park, and we had a fairly isolated spot near the water. There was a live         concert there, and we were serenaded while we made and ate our dinner.       </p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2737.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2739.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>A stop at the University of Calgary for email.</td>    <td>Entering downtown Calgary.
