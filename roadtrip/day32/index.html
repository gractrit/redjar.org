Unable to just throw out the old tent (with         the broken poles), and just as unable to spend money to send a broken         tent to the east coast, we donated it to the local thrift shop. We were         sure that some little kid would doubtless need the fabric for a model         rocket parachute. </p>      <p>After stopping at home for some grilled cheese, the three of us venture         into the city for another excursion. The first stop is the Red Robin,         where Sophia is rumored to be a hostess. But for our whole stay she neither         works, or is scheduled to work, so we can't help being suspicious. Next         we all walk up to the city center where Sophia is meeting a friend for         dinner. We say goodbye and start walking in what is supposed to be the         general direction of REI (Eastern Mountain Sports for the West). But,         we are completely unable to stumble upon the store, and simply end up         doing some uphill sight seeing. </p>      <p>We make our way to the ferry and are happy to discover the little Mediterranean         cafe we stopped at on a previous visit is still in business. We buy a         sandwich for the ferry ride home, which we discover seems to move faster         when you are not hungry. </p>      <p>After feeding Ogden, who is happy to roam around Sophia's lawn, we head         to the local movie theater. The movie &quot;My Big Fat Greek Wedding&quot;         is playing. Corin and Jared rate it one thumb up- very silly and sometimes         a little too cute. After the movie we use the rest of the daylight to         explore Vashon Island by car. When it gets dark we wander around the carnival         set up for the strawberry festival, and then go back to Sophia's. Since         tomorrow is the big festival, we need to be sure to get some rest.</p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2620.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2624.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Do they have a graduate program in &quot;shipping and handling?&quot;</td>    <td>Sophia knows every other person we see.
