After two days of campgrounds without shower facilities, it was         great to have hot showers in the morning. We stopped at the grocery store         before setting out on the highway again.</p>      <p>Our first stop eastward today was Moose Jaw. (This is the real name of         the town.) We stopped to take a tour through the town's underground tunnels.         We choose to tour the story of the Chinese immigrants into Canada. A tour         guide took us through a series of underground tunnels recreated as the         Chinese immigrants would have seen them when they lived and worked below         the city. The tour was interesting, although cheesy, and we had to stifle         a laugh when the tour guide suddenly broke into character and started         yelling. </p>      <p>Our next stop in the city of Regina was a short one.We had a quick oil         change in town, and were thoroughly entertained by the three stooges working         there. Desperate for customers, these three all chatted at once, and couldn't         contain their enthusiasm to change our oil. We asked if there was anything         we should see in Regina, and it was the first silence we had while we         were there. </p>      <p>The land outside of cities is flat and after several hours of it, it         is boring. So we continued to zoom east on highway 1. Highway 1 is known         as the Trans Canada Highway. With such a name, and such a long road, you         would think it was a big road, when in fact it's one lane in each direction         in many places. Our hypothesis is that truckers don't actually use this         road for a primary route for hauling goods. Perhaps goods are simply brought         north/south from the US.</p>      <p>After listening to three hours straight of This American Life on the         road, we had crossed into Manitoba and arrived at the Spruce Woods Provincial         Park, home of the only desert in Manitoba. When told this by the woman         at the Manitoba welcome center, we were worried. But the park was actually         quite large and had many trees and lakes. It even had a store, mini-golf,         and of course mosquitoes. Once in the tent, if you were quiet, you could         hear the swarms of mosquitoes outside the tent buzzing like high pitch         bees, just waiting for you to open the door.</p>      </td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2766.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2764.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Downtown Moose Jaw.</td>    <td>Learning about the history of Moose Jaw while awaiting the underground       tour. </td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2767.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2771.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Corin puts a whole, melted, peanut butter cup in her mouth including the       wrapper.
