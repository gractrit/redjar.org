We drove straight         through to Redding and spent awhile checking the various hotel/motels         for vacancies. This is not an easy task with a holiday, a budget, and         a puppy. Finding nothing, we drove on the twisty and turny route 299.       </p>      <p>Luckily, this mountainous road is speckled with campsites. We found a         good site in the Douglas City Campground. And, even more good luck- the         town over, Weaverville, was hosting fireworks that very evening. </p>      <p>The fireworks were as good as only &quot;small towns trading their elementary         school budget for TNT&quot; could be. They towered over Lake Tahoe's display,         and were accompanied from our viewpoint by some rowdy town hooligans-         equally entertaining. </p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2417.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2418.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Not too super of a market- No Purina brand dog food. </td>    <td>Corin and Ogden both collect sugar pine cones. </td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2421.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2422.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>But Ogden eats hers. </td>    <td>This is what the day looked like on the CA interstate.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2423.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2425.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>An unsuccessful stop at the University of Southern California in Sacramento       to update the web page.</td>    <td>And behind door number one- Our new tent!</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2427.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2433.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Waiting for the fireworks is always better with ice cream.</td>    <td>Weaverville spectacular!</td>  </tr>  <tr align="right">     <td colspan="2"><hr size="1" noshade></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td colspan="2"><a href="../">Home</a> | &lt;- <a href="/roadtrip/day24">Day       24</a>| <a href="/roadtrip/day26">Day 26</a> -&gt;</td>  </tr></table><!-- start google analytics --><script src="http://www.google-analytics.com/urchin.js" type="text/javascript"></script><script type="text/javascript">_uacct = "UA-127434-1";urchinTracker();</script><!-- end google analytics --></body></html>
