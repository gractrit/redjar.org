We also looked for a dog park we heard about, but were unable         to find it. </p>      <p>We stopped for lunch at a Canadian grocery store, and ate at a riverside         park near the highway. We drove on through the Rocky Mountains for the         rest of the afternoon. The mountains are so high and mighty, and at times         we could not see to the top! We stopped a few times to admire the views,         but did our best to cover a good amount of distance. </p>      <p>We did, however, stop at the Alberta welcome center for awhile. This         welcome center rivals the Texan giant one, only because it was so scenic,         and had a clear blue pond filled with glacial waters. There were people         swimming, and after a game of fetch Ogden took a dip too. She has become         quite the little swimmer! At the rest stop we met another New Jersey liscense         plate, a musician playing at a musical festival in Calgary. (We did ascertain         that his girlfriend was from the town Corin grew up in, but we forgot         to ask him if he was famous. Opps.)</p>      <p>We exited the Rockies, and stopped in the tourist/ski town of Bamff.         Bamf was two busy streets of shops and restaurants, and we stopped there         for dinner. We wandered a bit, and then hurried off to camp for the night.         We stopped at the first provincial park we came to. But, the sacrifice         of last minute camping is sometimes listening to the lulling sound of         interstate all night. (Not to mention mosquitos the size of small birds.         We were unable to take a picture because they stole the camera.) Oh well,         that just means an early start for tomorrow! </p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2715.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2719.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Picnic lunch.</td>    <td>Back through the Rockies.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2720.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2723.jpg" width="199" height="300"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Rockies.Rockies.
