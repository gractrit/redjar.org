She found a T-Bone on the football field and was truly         overjoyed. She cavorted around with it, and played keep away from us.</p>      <p>Once in Utah, we took the scenic 128 towards Moab and the Arches National         Park. We stopped at a pull off. We ended up helping this guy who got his         van stuck in the sand. He was bringing boats to the water and stupidly         brought the van right down to the water. A woman with him had put her         family on a raft and was going to go with the guy to pick them up, when         she discovered he was stuck in the mud. We brought her back to the &quot;ranch&quot;         where she was staying so she could send someone down to help get the van         unstuck. She turned out to be from Amherst, MA.</p>      <p>After dropping the woman off, we continued into Moab for lunch. We got         some sandwiches and ate them in the shade. Ogden found another bone. Who         knew there were so many bones on the ground? Moab is quite touristy. Lots         of sporty people come here to mountain bike. The main street is full of         tourist shops.</p>      <p>After lunch we head to Arches National Park. A 18 mile road brings you         close to the arches and dramatic rock formations. We only ventured a couple         minutes from the car because of the 100 degree heat.</p>      <p>We continued on through Utah. The eastern half is not very hospitable,         which the sign on the highway warned about, &quot;No Services next 106         miles&quot;. There were, however, plenty of great views of both canyons         and mountains.</p>      <p>Still unsure about which state park to go to, we finally picked Millsite         State Park using Utah's excellent state park brochure. </p>      <p>The state park was right on a nice lake and there were only two other         groups there.All was wonderful until 1:00 am when gusty winds stressed         our tent until one of the tent poles snapped. It huffed and it puffed         and blew our tent down. We packed up camp in a rush and spent the rest         of the night sleeping in the car. </p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2274.jpg" width="199" height="300"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2275.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Camp in the morning.</td>    <td>A cool mountain near our campsite.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2276.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2285.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Welcome to Utah.
