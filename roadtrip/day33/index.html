Sophia drove         us over in her truck and we saw the booths, and fair food, and carnival         rides. After exploring, it was time for the big parade. This was truly         a motley lineup. There were cute kids in strawberry garb by the dozen,         paper mache dragons, boy scouts, and a handful of local businesses. But         the masterpiece of the parade was the Thriftway grocery store clerks.         They were dressed in white and black, with sunglasses, and pushing shopping         carts. They had an elaborate routine that involved weaving the carts around,         dancing, and walking in such unison that it put the local marching band         to shame. </p>      <p>We met Sophia's friend Erica at the parade, and went back to her house         on the beach for the afternoon. After testing the water of the Puget Sound,         we decided to swim in the heated pool instead. A fun time with some wacky         noodles was had by all. </p>      <p>On the way home we stopped to pick up some ingredients and had a nice         summer pesto and pasta for dinner. After which it was off to the strawberry         festivities once again. Sophia knows every other person we see. Jared         and Corin trade in the hectic strawberry atmosphere for a nice game of         bingo. But the bingo playing seniors were not open to us joining in the         middle of an eighty round tournament, and in the end we were denied access         to this gambling underberry of Vashon Island. </p>      <p>So, instead of bingo, Jared and Corin purchased a cotton candy and walked         around the lovely island for the evening. We ended up visiting a local         cohousing community. We met some nice residents, and learned about the         community. The area was a bit smushed, but the houses were pleasant in         their &quot;cape cod-ness.&quot; (shingle siding etc.)</p>      <p>Back to town, and back to bed. Tomorrow we are leaving for the San Juan         Islands. Our stay on Vashon, the only island in the Puget Sound without         a bridge, was wonderful. Thanks Sophia!!! (and her parents who were probably         starting to worry we were never leaving.)</p></td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2633.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2634.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Sophia's pond, and dock turned floating garden.</td>    <td>On to the Strawberry Festival.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2635.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2639.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left">     <td>Jared, with his new haircut, awaits the start of the parade.</td>    <td>Let the parade commence!</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2640.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2642.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Buzz Lightyear and Woody.</td>    <td>Sophia's mom holds the center of the banner.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2645.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2653.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>All sorts of whacky old tractors from John Deere to Volvo.</td>    <td>Dubya's got a big head full of nothing.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2654.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2655.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>They shipped a marching band in from Seattle.</td>    <td>Concept 2 oars from Morrisville, VT.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2657.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2658.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>Thriftway workers, perform in perfect unison.</td>    <td>People, lots of people.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2661.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2664.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td><p>Vashon Island Health Club<br>        (We don't know what Sophia's doing.)</p>      </td>    <td>At Sophia's friend's house we dip our toes in the frigid ocean water,       and choose to swim in the nearby pool instead.</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td colspan="2">&nbsp;</td>  </tr>  <tr align="center">     <td><img src="images/DCP_2667.jpg" width="300" height="199"></td>    <td><img src="images/DCP_2668.jpg" width="300" height="200"></td>  </tr>  <tr align="left" valign="top">     <td>To the Thriftway for some dinner fixin's.</td>    <td>Mmmmm.
